# ChatGPT + Enterprise data with Azure OpenAI

This sample demonstrates a few approaches for creating ChatGPT-like experiences over your own data. It uses Azure OpenAI Service to access the ChatGPT model (gpt-35-turbo and gpt3), and vector store (Pinecone, Redis and others) or Azure cognitive search for data indexing and retrieval.

The repo provides a way to upload your own data so it's ready to try end to end.

## Updates

* 7/23/2023 - Added the rest of the feature for PIB UI and initial version of generating the PowerPoint deck as the output.  For new feature added ensure you add `FMPKEY` variable to webapp configuration.
* 7/20/2023 - Added feature to talk to Pib Data (Sec Filings & Earning Call Transcript).  Because new Auzre function is deployed, ensure `PIBCHAT_URL` property is added to Azure WebApp with the URL for your deployed Azure Functions
* 7/18/2023 - Refactored the PIB code to solve some of the performance issue and bug fixes.
* 7/17/2023 - Removed GPT3 chat interface with retirement of "Davinci" models.
* 7/16/2023 - Initial version of Pib UI (currently supporting 5 Steps - Company Profile, Call Transcripts, Press Releases, Sec Filings and Ratings/Recommendations).  You will need access to Paid subscription (FMP or modify based on what your enterprise have access to).  To use with FMP you will need to add `FmpKey` in Azure Functions.  Because of circular dependency you need to manually add `SecDocPersistUrl` and `SecExtractionUrl` manually in Azure Functions.
* 7/14/2023 - Add support for GPT3.5 16K model and ability to chunk document > 4000 tokens with > 500 overlap.  For the ChunkSize > 4000, it will default to 16K token for both QnA and Chat functionality. Added identity provider to the application and authentication for QnA and Chat interface.  For GPT3.5 16k model, you will need to add `OpenAiChat16k` property in Azure Function app.
* 7/13/2023 - Allow end user to select ChunkSize and ChunkOverlap Configuration.  Initial version of overriding prompt template.
* 7/11/2023 - Functional PIB CoPilot in the form of the [notebook](./Workshop/10_PibCoPilot.ipynb).  UI will be added soon.
* 7/8/2023 - Added the feature to Rename the session for ChatGPT.   Also added the UI for the Evaluator Tool.  This feature focuses on performing the LLM based evaluation on your document. It auto-generates the test dataset (with Question and Answers) and perform the grading on that document using different parameters and generates the evaluation results.  It is built on [Azure Durable Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview?tabs=csharp-inproc) and is implemented using the [Function Chaining](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-sequence?tabs=csharp) pattern. You will need to add `BLOB_EVALUATOR_CONTAINER_NAME` (ensure the same container name is created in storage account) and `RUNEVALUATION_URL`  (URL of the Durable function deployment) configuration in Azure Web App for existing deployment and if you want to use the Evaluator feature.  In the Azure function deployment add `AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags` (value EnableWorkerIndexing) and `OpenAiEvaluatorContainer` settings.
* 7/5/2023 - Added the feature to Delete the session.  That feature requires the feature that is in [preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/how-to-delete-by-partition-key?tabs=python-example) and you will need to enable that on the CosmosDB account on your subscription.  Added simple try/catch block in case if you have not enabled/deployed the CosmosDB to continue chatGPT implementation.
* 7/4/2023 - Initial version of storing "Sessions" for GPT3.5/ChatGpt interface.  Session and messages are stored/retrieved from CosmosDb.  Make sure you have CosmosDb service provisioned or create a new one (for existing deployment).  You will need to add `CosmosEndpoint`, `CosmosKey`, `CosmosDatabase` and `CosmosContainer` settings in both Azure Functions App and Web App. 
* 6/25/2023 - Notebook [showcasing](#qa-llm-evaluation) the evaluation of the answer quality in systematic way (auto generating questions and evaluation chain), supporting LLM QA settings (chunk size, overlap, embedding technique). Refer to [Evaluator](./Workshop/99_Evaluator.ipynb) notebook for more information.
* 6/18/2023 - Add the admin page supporting Knowledge base management.  
* 6/17/2023 - Added "Question List" button for Ask a question feature to display the list of all the questions that are in the Knowledge base.  Following three properties `SEARCHSERVICE`, `SEARCHKEY` and `KBINDEXNAME` (default value of aoaikb) needs to be added to Azure App Service to enable "Question List" button feature.
* 6/16/2023 - Add the feature to use Azure Cognitive Search as Vector store for storing the [cached Knowledge base](#qa-over-your-data-with-cache).  The questions that are not in KB are sent to LLM model to find the answer via OAI, or else it is responded back from the Cached Datastore.  New Property `KbIndexName` needs to be added to Azure Function app.  Added the Notebook to test out the feature as part of the workshop. TODO : Add the feature to add the question to KB from the chat interface (and make it session based). A feature further to "regenerate" answer from LLM (instead of cached answer) will be added soon.  
* 6/7/2023 - Add OpenAI Playground in Developer Tools and initial version of building the CoPilot (for now with Notebook, but eventually will be moved as CoPilot feature).  Add the script, recording and example for Real-time Speech analytics use-case.  More to be added soon.
* 5/27/2023 - Add Workshop content in the form of the notebooks that can be leveraged to learn/execute the scenarios.  You can find the notebooks in the [Workshop](Workshop) folder.  Details about workshop content is available [here](READMEWORKSHOP.md).
* 5/26/2023 - Add Summarization feature to summarize the document either using stuff, mapreduce or refine summarization.  To use this feature (on existing deployment) ensure you add the `OpenAiSummaryContainer` configuration to Function app and `BLOB_SUMMARY_CONTAINER_NAME` configuration to Azure App Service (Ensure that the value you enter is the same as the container name in Azure storage and that you have created the container).  You also need to add `PROCESSSUMMARY_URL` configuration to Azure App Service (Ensure that the value you enter is the same as the Azure Function URL).
* 5/24/2023 - Add feature to upload CSV files and CSV Agent to answer/chat questions on the tabular data.  Smart Agent also supports answering questions on CSV data.
* 5/22/2023 - Initial version of "Smart Agent" that gives you flexibility to talk to all documents uploaded in the solution.  It also allow you to talk to SQL Database Scenario.  As more features are added, agent will keep on building upon that (for instance talk to CSV/Excel or Tabular data)
* 5/21/2023 - Add Developer Tools section - Experimental code conversion and Prompt guru.
* 5/17/2023 - Change the edgar source to Cognitive search vector store instead of Redis.
* 5/15/2023 - Add the option to use "Cognitive Search" as Vector store for storing the index.  Azure Cognitive Search offers pure vector search and hybrid retrieval â€“ as well as a sophisticated re-ranking system powered by Bing in a single integrated solution. [Sign-up](https://aka.ms/VectorSearchSignUp). Support uploading WORD documents.
* 5/10/2023 - Add the options on how document should be chunked.  If you want to use the Form Recognizer, ensure the Form recognizer resource is created and the appropriate application settings `FormRecognizerKey` and `FormRecognizerEndPoint` are configured.
* 5/07/2023 - Option available to select either Azure OpenAI or OpenAI.  For OpenAI ensure you have `OpenAiApiKey` in Azure Functions settings.  For Azure OpenAI you will need `OpenAiKey`, `OpenAiService` and `OpenAiEndPoint` Endpoint settings.  You can also select that option for Chat/Question/SQL Nlp/Speech Analytics and other features (from developer settings page).
* 5/03/2023 - Password required for Upload and introduced Admin page starting with Index Management
* 4/30/2023 - Initial version of Task Agent Feature added.  Autonomous Agents are agents that designed to be more long running. You give them one or multiple long term goals, and they independently execute towards those goals. The applications combine tool usage and long term memory.  Initial feature implements [Baby AGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) with execution tools
* 4/29/2023 - AWS S3 Process Integration using S3, AWS Lambda Function and Azure Data Factory (automated deployment not available yet, scripts are available in /Deployment/aws folder)
* 4/28/2023 - Fix Bugs, Citations & Follow-up questions across QA & Chat.  Prompt bit more restrictive to limit responding from the document.
* 4/25/2023 - Initial version of Power Virtual Agent
* 4/21/2023 - Add SQL Query & SQL Data tab to SQL NLP and fix Citations & Follow-up questions for Chat & Ask features
