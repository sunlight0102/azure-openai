# ChatGPT + Enterprise data with Azure OpenAI

This sample demonstrates a few approaches for creating ChatGPT-like experiences over your own data. It uses Azure OpenAI Service to access the ChatGPT model (gpt-35-turbo and gpt3), and vector store (Pinecone, Redis and others) or Azure cognitive search for data indexing and retrieval.

The repo provides a way to upload your own data so it's ready to try end to end.
