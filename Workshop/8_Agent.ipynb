    "Agents use an LLM to determine which actions to take and in what order. An action can either be using a tool and observing its output, or returning to the user. When used correctly agents can be extremely powerful. The purpose here is to show you how to easily use agents through the simplest, highest level API on everything that we have built so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to load agents, you should understand the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tool: A function that performs a specific duty. This can be things like: Bing Search, Database lookup (AskSql), Python REPL (AskTabularData), other chains(AskQuestions). The interface for a tool is currently a function that is expected to have a string as an input, with a string as an output.\n",
    "- LLM: The language model powering the agent.\n",
    "- Agent: The agent to use. This should be a string that references a support agent class. \n",
