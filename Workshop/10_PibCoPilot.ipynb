    "PIBs are also used to create a pitchbook by assessing a company's strategy, competitive positioning, review of financial statements, industry dynamics, and trends within the industry. \n",

    "- News releases: News articles that may affect a company's stock price or growth prospect would be something that analysts look into, particularly within a 6-12 month time horizon.\n",
    "- SEC filings: These regulatory documents require a company to file Form 10-K and Form 10-Q with the SEC on an ongoing basis. Form 10-K is a financial overview and commentary for the last year, usually found on the company's website. Form 10-Q is similar to form 10-K, but it is a report for the last quarter instead of the previous year.\n",
    "- Equity research reports: Look into key forecasts for metrics like Revenue, EBITDA, and EPS for the company or competing firms to form a consensus estimate. \n",
    "- Investor Presentations: Companies provide historical information as an important foundation from which forecasts are made to guide key forecasting drivers. \n",
    "- Press Release: Can be found in the investor relations section of most companies' websites and contains the financial statements which are used in forms 10-K and 10-Q. \n",
    "- Conference calls: The same day a company issues its quarterly press release, it will also hold a conference call. On the call, analysts often learn details about management guidance. These conference calls are transcribed by several service providers and can be accessed by subscribers of large financial data providers."

      "Apple Inc. reported an 8% increase in total net sales for fiscal year 2022, totaling $28.5 billion. This was driven by higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Mac, as well as several new product, service and software offerings, including updated MacBook Pro 14” and 16”, powered by the Apple M1 Pro or M1 Max chip, third generation of AirPods, updated iPhone SE with 5G technology, and all-new Mac Studio, powered by the Apple M1 Max or M1 Ultra chip. Weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on all Products and Services net sales during 2022. The Company reported strong financial results for the 2022 fiscal year, with the introduction of several new products and services. Products gross margin increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due to a different product mix and higher product volume, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Operating expenses for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, engineering program costs, advertising and professional services. Other income/(expense), net was reported as $1.2 billion in 2022, $1.3 billion in 2021 and $1.2 billion in 2020. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes. The Company has manufacturing purchase obligations for components and other materials used in the production of its products, with $7.2 billion payable within 12 months. The Company has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors which does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares.

      "Risk Disclosures : \n",
      "Apple Inc. is exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. To manage these risks, the Company has implemented an investment policy and strategy focused on preserving capital and supporting liquidity requirements. The Company has also entered into foreign currency forward and option contracts and interest rate swaps to convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on certain of its foreign currency derivative positions. As of September 24, 2022, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense to increase by $201 million on an annualized basis. The Company must remain aware of the potential for significant changes in the future due to the unpredictable nature of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.\n",
