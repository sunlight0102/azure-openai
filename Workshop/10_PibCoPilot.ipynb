    "1. Company Overview and Executive Bio - A brief description of the company and its key executives with biographies.\n",
    "2. Conference calls: The same day a company issues its quarterly press release, it will also hold a conference call. On the call, analysts often learn details about management guidance. These conference calls are transcribed by several service providers and can be accessed by subscribers of large financial data providers.\n",
    "3. Press Release: Can be found in the investor relations section of most companies' websites and contains the financial statements which are used in forms 10-K and 10-Q. \n",
    "4. News: News articles that may affect a company's stock price or growth prospect would be something that analysts look into, particularly within a 6-12 month time horizon.\n",
    "5. SEC filings: These regulatory documents require a company to file Form 10-K and Form 10-Q with the SEC on an ongoing basis. Form 10-K is a financial overview and commentary for the last year, usually found on the company's website. Form 10-Q is similar to form 10-K, but it is a report for the last quarter instead of the previous year.\n",
    "6. Equity research reports: Look into key forecasts for metrics like Revenue, EBITDA, and EPS for the company or competing firms to form a consensus estimate. \n",
    "7. Investor Presentations: Companies provide historical information as an important foundation from which forecasts are made to guide key forecasting drivers. "
